Project 1:Flight Price Prediction (Regression)
To build an end-to-end project to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple factors such as departure time, source, destination, and airline type. Use the provided dataset to process, clean, and perform feature engineering. Train a regression model to predict flight prices and deploy the model in a Streamlit application. The app should allow users to input filters (route, time, and date) and get a predicted price for their flight.

Project 2:Customer Satisfaction Prediction (Classification)
Build a classification model to predict customer satisfaction levels based on features such as customer feedback, demographics, and service ratings. Use the provided dataset to process, clean, and perform feature engineering. Deploy the model in a Streamlit application, allowing users to input customer data and receive a predicted satisfaction level.

Code Takeaways:
1)Random Forest based Regression model to find the Flight Price.
2)Random Forest based Classification model to classify the Customer Satisfaction.
3)A streamlit application code combining both the models.
